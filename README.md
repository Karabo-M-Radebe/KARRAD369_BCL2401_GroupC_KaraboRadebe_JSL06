# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

# Project Overview
In this challenge, This challenge helped apply various JavaScript concepts, including functions, closures, and event handling, to create an interactive menu.

# Project Brief
In this coding challenge, I had to build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal was to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. 
The brief required that I:
- Create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page.
- Implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order.
- Use closures to maintain the state of the order.
- Utilise function expressions and anonymous functions.
- Call built-in functions and create custom functions to manage the menu and order system.


# Elements included 
- Ensuring that my code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
- My GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
Although not many challenges were faced during this project, I wouldn't neccesarily claim mastery over any element that was included. I do however I will say that implementing functions has become a lot easier and I have become more comfortable with that.

### Challenges faced 
Not many challenges were faced throughout this project, it was fairly easy in terms of execution and finding the solutions. This was due to the knowledge that was gained throughout the previous projects as I was able to implement solutions from previous projects. 

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on moving forward, isn't necessarily skilled based, but rather a habit based one; being that I would greatly improving my coding skills if I were to return to the basics and better understand syntax structure and other basic concepts that are required as building blocks.  

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was a lot smoother than anticipated. Having just finished my JSL05 project and struggling with the learning process, I came to find that learning about Functions and their various attributes like declaring and scoping them, was far easier than manipulating array structures with the use of functional programming methods. I really enjoyed learning throughout this project and I look forward to using this skills in future projects.
